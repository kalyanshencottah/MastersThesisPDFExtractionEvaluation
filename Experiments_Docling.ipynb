       "The type of  vegetation  and  soil  organic  matter  affect the  carbon  fraction,  nitrogen  fraction  and  soil carbon stocks that contribute to the global carbon cycle. Therefore, the calculation of the composition of the fractions in different land covers is very important as a potential indicator of the effect of land management practices on soil organic carbon dynamics and supports the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and soil carbon storage. This research aimed to determine the composition of the carbon fraction, nitrogen fraction and soil carbon stock in different land cover. There were six types of land cover with vegetations of 10-year-old bamboo, 30-year-old bamboo, 50-year-old bamboo, bulrush, a mixture of brushwood and bulrush, and a mixture of Albizia falcataria and brushwood, each of which was sampled three times. Soil samples were used to determine microbial biomass, particulate organic, humic acid, fulvic acid and soil carbon stock. The six land cover types showed significant differences in all fractions and soil carbon stocks. Fifty-year-old bamboo vegetation has the highest carbon storage of 0.029 g g -1 soil.  The  stable  carbon  fraction,  in  the  form  of  humic  acid  and  fulvic  acid,  in  50-year-old  bamboo vegetation is more excellent than that in other vegetation. This study shows that 50-year-old bamboo vegetation  has  the  potential  to  sequester  carbon  and  store  carbon  in  forms  that  decompose  slowly, namely humic acid and fulvic acid, in the soil for a longer period.\n",

       "## INTRODUCTION\n",
       "\n",
       "Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have increased by 25%  since the  late  18 th century  (Khorramdel  et  al.,  2019). Conventional management, intensive processing, use of fossil fuels, changes in land cover conditions (grasslands to dry land and deforestation)  and  burning  of  crop  residues  are some of the factors that increase the concentration of  CO2  in  the  atmosphere  (Li  et  al.,  2015).  An increase in the content of CO2 in the atmosphere will cause an increase in the earth's temperature due  to  the  greenhouse  effect  (Anderson  et  al., 2016; Ahima, 2020). Soil can potentially expand\n",
       "\n",
       "carbon sequestration and allow a prospective way of mitigating increases in atmospheric CO2 (Lal, 2004). Soil is a storehouse of absorption/storage of  carbon  from  the  atmosphere  through  plants (Lal  et  al.,  2015).  Management  of  aboveground vegetation is considered one of the strategies for climate change mitigation and is related to carbon storage (Kwiatkowski et al., 2023).\n",
       "\n",
       "Sustainable agriculture is an effort to maintain the survival of farmers, resources and communities with more environmentally friendly and profitable farming practices (Mehmet Tuğrul, 2020). Sustainable agriculture can be interpreted as  returning  nutrients  to  the  soil  by  minimizing\n",
       "\n",
       "the  use  of  non-renewable  natural  resources  to maintain or improve environmental quality and  conserve  natural  resources  (Muhie,  2022). Bamboo  plants  can  use  carbon  sources  from the air  (Lobovikov  et al., 2012). Bamboo plants can absorb carbon, which will later be converted into soil organic carbon (SOC) (Zachariah et al., 2016). Carbon absorption in the air helps reduce global  warming  (Nath  et  al.,  2009).  Bamboo plants  also  use  little  or  no  artificial  fertilizers, thereby minimizing the use of artificial fertilizers (Saputri  et  al.,  2021).  The  litter  produced  from bamboo  can  also  provide  a  source  of  nutrients to the soil and can be used by other plants (Sofiah et  al.,  2018).  Bamboo  can  be  used  as  biochar material (Huang et al., 2011). Biochar in the soil can increase nutrient uptake, increase water holding capacity, reduce nutrient leaching and soil degradation,  increase  cation  exchange  capacity (CEC), increase biomass and microorganism abundance, and help neutralize soil pH (Houben et  al.,  2013;  K.  Lu  et  al.,  2017;  C.  Wang  et  al., 2018).\n",
       "\n",
       "Bamboo  plants can contribute to climate change  mitigation  efforts  and  reduce  CO2  in the  atmosphere  (Yiping  et  al.,  2010).  Studies that have been conducted show that the bamboo plant  ecosystem  can  store  between  92  to  392 tons of carbon per hectare (tC ha -1 ) (King et al., 2021).  The mechanism  of  the  carbon cycle occurs when CO2 is absorbed during photosynthesis,  stored  in  biomass  and  released due to the decomposition of dead organic matter  (Dwivedi  et  al.,  2019).  Bamboo  plants have higher biomass production, thus contributing high  soil  organic  matter  and  affecting  carbon storage  in  the  soil  (Li  et  al.,  2015).  Sujarwo (2016)  stated  that  carbon  storage in bamboo vegetation ( Dendrocalamus  asper Back )  was . 43.67  mg  ha -1 .  Previous  research  conducted  by Sohel  et  al.  (2015)  in  the  Lawachara  Protected Forest of Bangladesh showed that carbon storage in bamboo  plants  was  more  potential  (15.53 ton  ha -1 year -1 )  than  that  in  other  fast-growing tree species vegetation, such as Acacia auriculiformis (10.21 ton ha -1 year -1 ) and Eucalyptus camaldulensis (10.12 ton ha -1 year -1 ). Another  study  by  Song  et  al.  (2011)  showed that total carbon  storage  capacity  in  bamboo ecosystem ( Phyllostachys pubescens ) in India was 106.36  ton  ha -1 ,  where  the  above-soil  biomass stored  carbon  of  34.3  ton  ha -1 (32.3%  of  total carbon)  and  underground  biomass  (0  to  60  cm soil depth) stored carbon of 72.2 ton ha -1 (67.7% of total carbon).\n",

       "Soil carbon stocks are organic carbon stores in the soil (Buraka et al., 2022). The carbon fraction, nitrogen fraction and soil carbon stock are affected  by  organic  matter  in  the  soil  (Frazão et  al.,  2021).  The  carbon  and  nitrogen  fractions in the soil play an important role in maintaining the quality of soil fertility and  plant  growth and  affecting  soil  carbon  stores  (Gerke,  2022; Huntingford  et  al.,  2022).  Nitrogen  and  carbon in the soil have stable and labile fractions (Wijanarko and Purwanto, 2017). The  labile carbon and nitrogen fractions are microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, organic particulate carbon and organic particulate nitrogen (J. Wang and Sainju, 2014). The stable carbon fractions are humic  and fulvic acids (Sijabat  et  al.,  2018).  Soil microbial  biomass carbon refers to the microbial biomass that decomposes  organic  matter  (Lepcha  and  Devi, 2020).  Microbial  biomass  nitrogen  is  the  most volatile source of soil nitrogen because it is related to  nitrogen  mineralization  (Moore  et  al.,  2000). Organic  particulate  carbon  is  a  substrate  and carbon source used for metabolic processes affecting soil aggregation (Semenov et al., 2019). The  organic  particulate  nitrogen  fraction  is  the primary nitrogen source for soil microbes (Martínez et al., 2017). Soil-stable carbon fractions,  including  humic  acid  and  fulvic  acid, have a role in high CEC, the ability of soil to hold water,  increasing  plant  growth  and  improving soil fertility (Kusumawati  et  al.,  2020).  Soil carbon stocks are organic carbon stores in the soil (Buraka  et  al.,  2022).  Carbon  fraction,  nitrogen fraction and carbon  stock are influenced by organic matter in the soil (Frazão et al., 2021).\n",
       "\n",
       "The  composition of the labile and stable fractions in the soil will affect soil carbon stores (Qian  et  al.,  2021).  The  labile  carbon  fraction is a fraction that is easily decomposed by microorganisms,  so  its  presence  in  the  soil  is quickly  lost  (Zhang  et  al.,  2020).  The  stable carbon  fraction  is  a  fraction  that  is  decomposed very slowly by microorganisms so that its presence  in  the  soil  lasts  longer  than  the  labile fraction  (Gautam  et  al.,  2021).  Understanding the  impact  of  changes  in  land  cover  on  carbon fractions,  nitrogen  fractions  and  SOC  stocks  is very important in designing sustainable management  of  carbon  stocks.  Improving  the ability  of  soils  to  store  carbon  is  essential,  both for  sustainable  agriculture  and  climate  change mitigation. Information on the content of carbon fractions, nitrogen fractions and SOC  stocks in Indonesia still needs to be improved. Therefore,\n",

       "Soil texture was determined using the pipetting method (Bouyoucos, 1962). The weight of the root density was determined using the method of calculating root weight (g) with volume (cm ) 3 of  soil  sampling  (Yang  et  al.,  2010).  The  roots were  taken  using  a  sample  ring  separated  from the adhering soil. The weight was calculated and the root weight density was  analyzed using the root weight formula divided by the volume of the  sample  ring.  Bulk  density  was  determined using the sample ring method (ISRIC, 1993). SOC was  determined  using  the  Walkey  and  Black method (Graham, 1948). Soil total  nitrogen  was determined  using  the  Kjehdahl  method  (ISRIC, 1993). The CEC was estimated using the ammonium chloride method (ISRIC, 1993).

       "The  root  weight  density  at  all  sites  showed the  highest  value  at  a  depth  of  0  to  10  cm and  decreased  with  the  increasing  soil  depth (Figure 3a). The highest root weight density was in  the  site  with  50-year-old  bamboo  vegetation, and  the lowest  was  in  the  sites with  mixed vegetation of A. falcataria and brushwood (Table  2).  The  root  weight  density  at  the  study sites ranged from 3.56 to 20.54 mg cm -3 . The root density  was  higher  in  the  bamboo  vegetation (Table  2).  The  advantage  of  bamboo  plants  is that they have a rhizome root system that can last for years  and  grow  laterally  to  produce  new side shoots that develop into new rhizomes (Xiao et  al.,  2021).  This  is  in  line  with  the  results  of researchers  study,  showing  that  the  root  weight increased with the increasing age of the bamboo rhizomes  at  the  study  site.  This  study  shows that the decrease in root weight that occurs with increasing soil depth is caused by the root system of bamboo  plants'  rhizomes  distribution that occurs  maximally  at a soil  depth  of  0  to  30  cm (Shi  et  al.,  2021).  Several  studies  have  shown that  most  trees  and  shrubs'  roots  are  distributed vertically  into  the  soil  to  a  soil  depth  of  60  cm (Schmid  and  Kazda,  2002;  Gao  et  al.,  2020). Therefore, in this research, vegetation other than bamboo has a lower root weight.\n",

       "The  bulk  density  distribution  increased  with the increasing soil depth (Figure 3b). There was no  significant  effect  of  land  covers  on  the  bulk density (Table 2). Bulk density at the study sites ranged from 0.89 to 1.39 mg cm -3 .  Bulk  density increased  with  soil  depth  in  layers  0  to  40  cm (Figure 3b). In line with the results of research by Wu et al. (2023), an increase in bulk density was caused  by  a  gradual  decrease  in  SOC  content (Figure  3c)  with  increasing  soil  depth,  which would reduce soil permeability. In addition, it may also be due to the influence of plant roots. In  the  top  layer  (0  to  10  cm),  the  bulk  density value  was  the  lowest  compared  to  other  soil layers, which was  caused  by  the abundance of plant roots (Figure 3a) in the top layer. The  decrease  in  bulk  density  is  due  to  root decomposition,  which  will  increase  soil  organic matter  (Athira  et  al.,  2019).  Besides,  roots  can increase soil porosity and infiltration rate, thereby reducing bulk density (Ontl et al., 2015).\n",
       "\n",
       "The SOC was the highest in the top layer of soil with a depth of 0 to 10 cm and decreased with the increasing soil depth (Figure 3c). There was no  significant  effect  of  land  covers  on  the  SOC (Table  2),  but  SOC  was  higher  in  the  bamboo vegetation. SOC at the study site ranged from 2.07 to  55.12  g  kg -1 soil.  The  type  of  vegetation  and soil depth influence SOC. In this study, SOC was the  highest  in  layers  0  to  10  cm  (Figure  3c) and  decreased  with  the  increasing  soil  depth at sites 3, 4, 5 and 6. The high SOC was due to the accumulation of litter and distribution of high roots. Carbon in the soil will increase if there is plant litter on the ground and root decomposition by microorganisms (Zhou et al., 2013). Plant roots also affect the organic carbon content of the soil. A well-developed root system can increase SOC because  organic  carbon  is  released  through  root exudation  and  dead  root  tissue  (Y.  Wang  et  al., 2015). Litter on bamboo  plants is abundant and  easily decomposed, thereby increasing SOC (Qin  et  al.,  2017).  The  results  of  the  analysis conducted by Maulana et al. (2020) reported that the  lignin  content  of  bamboo  ( D.  asper Back.) leaves was  24.8%,  which  is  included  in  the medium  criteria,  so  it  is  easy  to  decompose. The decomposition process results in fulvic acid and  humic  acid,  which  are  part  of  the  organic carbon in the soil (Syamsiyah et al., 2019).\n",

       "The total nitrogen decreased with the increasing  soil  depth  at  all  sites  (Figure  3d). Total  nitrogen  (Table  2)  significantly  differed at all locations, except sites 3 and 4. It was higher in bamboo vegetation. Total nitrogen at the study site  ranged  from  0.67  to  2.75  g  kg -1 soil.  This aspect was affected by the type of vegetation and soil depth. In this study, total nitrogen decreased with the increasing soil depth. Nitrogen reduction is caused  by  vegetation  biomass  and  biomass quality (X. Lu et al., 2021). Litter decomposition is  influenced  by  nitrogen  concentration  and  the C/N ratio of biomass. A low C/N ratio of biomass means  that  it  has  a  relatively  higher  nitrogen concentration,  which  will  accelerate  microbial activity and increase litter decomposition because microorganisms are not limited by nitrogen (Dong et al., 2023). This is in line with the results of  this  study,  showing  that  nitrogen  in  bamboo vegetation  is  higher  because  bamboo  litter  is easily decomposed, thereby increasing soil nitrogen content. Soil nitrogen content was higher at a  depth  of  0  to  20  cm  than  that  at  a  depth  of 20  to  40  cm.  This  is  because  there  is  more supply  of  organic  matter  in  the  top  layer  than in the bottom layer. This is also influenced by the presence  of  soil  microorganisms  that  accelerate the  decomposition  process.  According  to  Meng et al. (2022),  an  increase  in  soil nitrogen  is\n",

       "There was no significant effect of the type of land cover on the soil C/N ratio (Table 2). The soil C/N  ratio was  higher  in bamboo  vegetation. The value of the C/N ratio of the soil at the study site ranged from 15.68 to 28.84. The C/N ratio of soil  in  non-bamboo  vegetation  land  was  greater than  that  in  bamboo  vegetation  land.  The  low nitrogen  content  of  non-bamboo  vegetation  will result in the low activity of microorganisms due to a lack of nitrogen elements, so the decomposition process runs slowly (Meng et al., 2022). The C/N ratio is used to indicate the possibility of nitrogen deficiency and competition among microbes and  higher  plants  in  using  available  nitrogen in  the  soil  (Jones  et  al.,  2018).  There  was  no significant  effect  of  the  type  of  land  cover  on the  CEC  (Table  2).  The  CEC  at  the  study  sites ranged  from  21.65  to  33.44  cmol  kg -1 soil.  The high  CEC  in  this  study  was  influenced  by  soil organic  matter  content  and  soil  pH  (H.  Wang et  al.,  2015).  In  line  with  the  research  of  Juhos et al. (2021),  the  CEC  is  linearly  correlated with soil pH, meaning that an increase in soil pH will cause an increase in CEC. In this study, it was proven that the CEC increased with the increasing soil  pH  (Table  2).  Organic  matters  have  greater cation adsorption capacity because organic materials will increase the negative charge, thereby  increasing  the  CEC.  Humus  colloid  is a source of 20 to 70% CEC (Nesic et al., 2015).\n",

       "The  type  of  land  cover  did  not  significantly affect  soil  pH  of  H2 O (Table 2). The soil pH of H2O at the study sites ranged from 6.12 to 6.34, which is included in acidic pH criteria. The soil pH  of  H2O  in  the  bamboo  vegetation  land  was higher and close to neutral pH. Neutral soil pH is influenced by organic matter. The decomposition process will produce negatively charged organic compounds that can bind cations (Rahmadaniarti and Mofu, 2020). Organic matter has the ability to buffer soil pH because in organic matter, there are  carboxyl  functional  groups  that  can  release or bind H  (Wong and Swift, 2001). Soil texture + at  the  study  site  is  dominated  by  sand  texture. The soil texture in sites 1, 2, 5 and 6 is loamy sand, while  in  sites  3  and  4,  the  soil  texture  is  sandy loam  (Table  2).  This  difference  occurs  because there is an increase in clay and silt at sites 3 and 4, causing  different texture groups. Soil texture will  affect  the  soil's  ability  to  store  and  provide plant  nutrients  (Chakraborty  and  Mistri,  2015). The  clay  fraction  can  attract  and  hold  nutrients\n",

C POM at sites 5 and 6 was significantly affected  by  the  type  of  land  cover  (Table  3). However, at sites 1, 2, 3 and 4, the bamboo and non-bamboo land cover did not show significant effect.

(2015) stating  that  the  amount  of  organic  matter  (litter) is the main factor controlling the C POM content in the soil. In addition, land without  tillage will also increase residues on the soil surface and reduce the decomposition rate (Desrochers et al., 2020),  resulting  in  the  accumulation  of  organic matter and improving soil aggregation. Increasing soil aggregation will increase the C POM (Chan, 2003).\n",

Overall, the C POM concentration was higher in bamboo vegetation and was highest in bamboo vegetation (50  years)  of  2.45  g  kg -1 soil.  The  correlation results signify that C POM is positively related to N  POM,  soil carbon stock, SOC  and  total nitrogen. This research is in line with the study of Xing  et  al.  (2022),  reporting  that  an  increase  in N  POM,  soil  carbon  stock,  SOC  and  nitrogen was followed by an increase in C POM content. This  research  showed  that  bamboo  vegetation had  higher  SOC  and  nitrogen  values  (Table  4).

The  results  showed that at sites 1, 2, 3 and 4, the activity of microorganisms  occurred  more  on  non-bamboo vegetation land as indicated by the higher C Mic. Meanwhile, the opposite happened at sites 5 and 6. The correlation results showed that C Mic had a negative relationship with soil pH. Differences in  C  Mic  content  are  caused  by  environmental factors  in  the  soil.  These  environmental  factors include nutrients, soil pH, aeration and drainage, and  the  availability  of  energy  sources  (Rahman et al., 2021). These factors will affect the activity of microorganisms, thereby affecting soil microbial biomass. In addition, C Mic is correlated to root weight density. Roots  are a place of life and a source of energy for microorganisms. High root weight indicates that  the  activity  of  microorganisms  in  the  soil is  high  since  carbon  in  root  exudate  provides a food supply for soil microorganisms (Xiao et al.,\n",

Soil  organic  matter is  the  primary  source  of  carbon,  nitrogen  and soil carbon stocks. The humic acid and fulvic acid fractions are constant carbons in the soil because they  decompose  slowly  in  nature.  Research  by Sible  et  al.  (2021)  concludes  that  the  carbon content in fulvic acid is higher than in humic acid. This is in line with the results of this present study (Table  3).  The  high  content  of  humic  acid  and fulvic  acid  in  the  bamboo  vegetation  is  due  to more  litter  in  the  bamboo  vegetation.  Litter  is a source of organic carbon and humic-fulvic acid. This  is  in  line  with  the  research  by  Wei  et  al.

Humic material plays an essential role in providing soil nutrients;  humic  material  mainly  consists of humic acid and fulvic acid; humic material is a crucial part of soil organic matter because it is closely related to soil carbon and nitrogen (Kõlli and Rannik, 2018).\n",

Root  carbon  stock  is carbon  in underground biomass, especially plant roots, with calculations in the methods chapter. Total soil carbon stock is the  sum  of  the  total  carbon  stored  in  soil  and roots. The results of the ANOVA analysis showed that the type of land cover significantly affected carbon stock (Sig. 0.000). The soil carbon stock at  all  sites  demonstrated  that  the  land  cover  of bamboo and non-bamboo had significantly different effect (Table 6). Soil carbon stock values at the study sites ranged from 0.015 to 0.029 g g -1 soil.\n",

This  is  in  line  with  this research,  in  which  an  increase  in  soil  carbon stock  was  followed  by  an  increase  in  SOC  and a decrease in bulk density (Table 2 and Table 5). This  study  showed  that  soil  carbon  stock  was positively related to SOC, total nitrogen and root weight  density.  The  SOC  (Table  2)  was  found the  highest  at  site  5,  in  line  with  the  results  of soil  carbon  stock  (Table  6).  Soil  carbon  stock comes from SOC, including subsurface biomass and  dead  organic  matter  (Shapkota  and  Kafle, 2021).  The highest soil carbon stock results were  at  site  5,  followed  by  the highest  root weight density (Table 2). Research by Lal (2005) explains  that  differences  in  the  diversity  of  soil carbon stocks occur because each vegetation type has a different distribution of roots.\n",

       "\n",
       "The highest carbon storage is found in bamboo vegetation land compared to non-bamboo vegetation  land.  The  composition  of  the  carbon fraction,  nitrogen  fraction  and  soil  carbon  stock is influenced by the physical-chemical properties of the soil, including root weight density, bulk  density,  pH  H2O,  SOC  and  total  nitrogen. Soil carbon stock and stable carbon composition (humic  acid  and  fulvic  acid)  are  the  highest  in 50-year-old bamboo vegetation, meaning carbon is  stored  in  the  soil  but  in  a  slowly  degraded form. Therefore, the potential for long-term carbon  storage  is  found  in  bamboo  vegetation. The increase in atmospheric CO2 can be reduced by  transferring/sequestering  carbon  into  the  soil (soil carbon sequestration). The amount of carbon stored in the soil represents the carbon removed from  the atmosphere. Soil carbon stock and\n",
